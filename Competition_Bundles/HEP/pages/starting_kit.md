#### ⚠️ Note:
Participants can submit a pre-trained model zipped together with the `model.py`. It is the participants responsibility to load the pre-trained model in the Model class. In this case participants may want to ignore the train_set provided as input of the Model class.

## Starting Kit
We are providing a starting kit as a Google Colab notebook to demonstrate the problem and a solution for it which can be submitted as a submission the competition. You can copy the Colab notebook and make changes as you want.
